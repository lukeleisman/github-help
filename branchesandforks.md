This file goes through helpful things on github branches and forks.

## Forking
- Forking is useful when you want to work on a project but don't have write access. 
- A fork is essentially a clone of someone elses repository, associated with your user.
- The idea is that you will create a fork which creates your own local repository where you make changes. 
Then you take out a pull request, which requests to merge your forked branch back in with the main.
